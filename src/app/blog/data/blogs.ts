      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">What is a Browser Privacy Analyzer?</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        A <strong>Browser Privacy Analyzer</strong> is a powerful tool designed to help users understand the personal and technical data their browser reveals when visiting websites. 
        This tool uncovers how websites track and identify you, highlighting the extent to which your digital presence can be exposed without your knowledge.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Key Data Websites Can Collect</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        When you access a website, various types of data may be collected. This includes <strong>Device & OS Information</strong> such as your OS version, screen resolution, and hardware specifications. 
        Your <strong>IP Address</strong> can reveal your location and network information. Through <strong>Browser Fingerprinting</strong>, websites can uniquely identify you using a combination of browser extensions, fonts, and system settings. 
        Additionally, <strong>Tracking Cookies and Local Storage</strong> are used to monitor and store your behavior for purposes such as targeting, analytics, and personalization.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Features of the Privacy Analyzer Tool</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The Privacy Analyzer Tool conducts a series of automated privacy tests to check your browser's exposure level. It presents the results in a clear and categorized format, making it easier for users to identify vulnerabilities. 
        This tool is designed to help you evaluate potential privacy leaks in your browser environment and provides insights that can help enhance your online safety.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Note on Account Detection Test</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        One notable feature of this analyzer is its ability to demonstrate how malicious websites can determine whether you are logged into popular platforms—<em>without your permission</em>. 
        It checks your session states with up to <strong>30 major websites</strong>, helping to illustrate just how easily your login status can be detected without you actively engaging with the site.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Why This Matters</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The tool is crucial in raising awareness about online privacy threats. Many internet users are unaware of how much data their browsers leak or how easily their activity can be tracked. 
        This tool teaches you how to configure your browser more securely to reduce such risks and encourages the adoption of privacy-conscious practices.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Takeaway</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In summary, even without disclosing your identity, a website can build a highly specific profile about you based on your browser data—often so unique that it matches only one person: you. 
        Using a Browser Privacy Analyzer reveals how exposed your browser really is and empowers you to take meaningful steps toward securing your online identity.

    title: 'Human Development Index (HDI) – India',

    content: `
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">What is the Human Development Index (HDI)?</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The <strong>Human Development Index (HDI)</strong> is a composite statistic developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to evaluate a country’s average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: health, education, and living standards. 
        Based on its score, a country is categorized into one of four development tiers: <em>very high</em>, <em>high</em>, <em>medium</em>, or <em>low</em> human development.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">What Does the HDI Measure?</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Health:</strong> Evaluated through <em>life expectancy at birth</em>, which reflects overall public health, nutrition, and medical access.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Education:</strong> Assessed by two indicators: <em>mean years of schooling</em> (average number of completed years of education among adults) and <em>expected years of schooling</em> for children entering school.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Standard of Living:</strong> Measured using <em>Gross National Income (GNI) per capita</em>, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), capturing the income and resources available to individuals.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">How is the HDI Calculated?</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>1. Normalization:</strong> Each component (health, education, and income) is normalized between minimum and maximum set values on a 0 to 1 scale.<br/><br/>
        <strong>2. Index Calculation:</strong> A geometric mean is then calculated across the three normalized indices to arrive at the final HDI value.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">India’s HDI Performance</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In <strong>2022</strong>, India’s HDI was <strong>0.644</strong>, placing the country in the <em>medium human development</em> category. India ranked <strong>134th</strong> out of 193 countries. This score marks a significant increase from <strong>0.434</strong> in <strong>1990</strong>, reflecting consistent progress over the decades.<br/><br/>
        In <strong>2023</strong>, India’s HDI rose to <strong>0.685</strong>, moving the country to the <strong>130th</strong> position. This brings India closer to the threshold for the <em>high human development</em> category (HDI ≥ 0.700).<br/><br/>
        The improvement is attributed to gains in <em>life expectancy</em>, <em>education levels</em>, and <em>GNI per capita</em>.
      </p>
  
      <h2 style="color: #3B82F6; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Conclusion</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The HDI provides a more holistic measure of a nation's progress beyond economic growth alone. India's steady rise in HDI reflects significant socio-economic development and improvements in quality of life. Continued investment in health, education, and income-generating opportunities will be key to moving into the high human development category.
